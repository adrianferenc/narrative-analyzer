# Grade Book / Narrative Analyzer

### This app is a gradebook that allows you to enter a student, a grade for that student, a narrative for that student, as well as apply categories to each student.

##### Why apply categories?
As a teacher at a progressive school, twice a year I would have to write a narrative for each student. A narrative is effectively a paragraph or so of text assessing the student in a number of ways.  

An aspect of my narratives I was always curious about was if different aspects of a student's identity correlated at all with my narratives. For instance, a student's grade level,  gender, height, or any other self-perceivable metric changed the way I wrote my narratives.  

In addition to this being a gradebook, it has some limited functionality in terms of being able to analyze the narratives quantifiably. As I did not want to inject any of my own bias into the results, the results are basically raw data, rather than conclusive in any specific way.

### Future Enhancements:
- AAU, I would like to log in and view only my students/narratives/categories
- AAU, I would like to have results show a histogram of grade distributions.
- AAU, when viewing all narratives/students, I would like to be able to filter by category.
- AAU, I want to be able to define my own comparison function to see in results.
